            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
            web browser.
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
            JavaScript.

        HTML works as the structure of a website, it allows the web developer to create and structure headings,
        paragraphs and sections. When working with HTML it is fundamental to know its structures
        (attributes and tags). HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension, making it readable for
        all browsers.
        During the development of this assignment HTML was the first thing to focus on, it was necessary for the
        creation of the navigation bar at the top of the webpage, the change of the title of the tab,
        the creation of headings/paragraphs and finally to link with the .css file and .js file.
